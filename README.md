#### Low-level Javascript 3D library ####

A very basic Web GL rendering library, based on JS ES6 modules, that I started from scratch for my [portfolio](https://cslv.me/).
I decided to share the code as-is, with some examples, in case this serves some projects somewhere.

### Demos ###

The examples can be executed in WebGL compatible browser by using a local webserver, eg. with python:

```sh
# Move to project base directory
cd plane-js

# Start a local web server with python
python3 -m http.server
```

You can then navigate to [localhost:8000/demos](http://localhost:8000/demos/) to execute the examples.

### Roadmap ###

There is no specific plan or roadmap for now. However, this code-base might grow based on any needs I might have, probably around shaders, creative coding, and lo-fi analog renderings.
